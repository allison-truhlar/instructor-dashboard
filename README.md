## Course Instructor Dashboard

This app allows an instructor to connect to the course they are currently teaching on the [Canvas Learning Management System ](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) via the [Canvas API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/) and view information about how far along the course currently is and what students need attention due to missing assignments or a low grade average. The user can access the student emails from the app. 

I was inspired to create this app based on my own experience as a an instructor for a large (~300 student) online class over nine semesters. It was difficult to easily visualize which students needed extra help and then directly contact them.

**Problem Statement:** As a lecturer for a large online class, I need to be able to assess my students‚Äô overall learning progress quickly and identify any students with whom I need to check in. 

**Product Solution:** A student learning dashboard that shows me key student learning metrics at a glance.

**Use Cases:**
1. Visualize overall student progress relative to the week in the syllabus
1. Identify students who are missing assignments
1. Identify students with a low grade average
1. Open an email to a student I need to check in with

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for use with your own Canvas API tokens.

### Prerequisites
1. **Install [Node 12.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**.
1. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

### Installation and setup
1. Fork this repo.
1. Copy clone link.
1. Open a terminal and clone the repo. `git clone {paste URL you copied}`
1. Navigate into repo. `cd instructor-dashboard`

#### Backend
1. Navigate into `backend` repo. `cd backend`
1. Install required dependencies. `npm install`
1. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder. 
1. Copy the snippet below into `.env`. Note - if you use Canvas through a school, replace "Canvas" with the acronym/word for your institution found in the URL path you use to access Canvas. E.g., [canvas.ubc.ca](http://canvas.ubc.ca/). In this case, you would input https://ubc.instructure.com/api/v1
    ```
    CANVAS_API_TOKEN=
    CANVAS_API_DOMAIN=https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1
    ```
1. Generate your Canvas access token by following the instructions found here: https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/for-students/canvas-api/.
1. In the `.env`, `CANVAS_API_TOKEN={Paste your token here}`
1. Save `.env`.
2. Now, start the server `npm start`.

> Never share your token with anyone. If you think your token may have been exposed (for example, by accidentally posting it to GitHub), delete your token from Canvas right away. Instructions for creating and deleting access tokens as a student are [available on the Canvas Guides](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16005-42121018197).

#### Frontend
1. Navigate into `frontend-vite` repo. `cd frontend-vite`
1. Install required dependencies. `npm install`
1. Start frontend application. `npm run dev`
1. You should see the app at http://localhost:5173/

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
* [ ] Finish responsive layout for larger screens (the app was created following mobile-first design principles)
* [ ] Refactor the grades and progress modules to render from the same component, by passing down different props
* [ ] Improve UX when app is accessing data from the API
* [ ] Make a log-in feature, so the user does not need to create a local .env file

## Acknowledgements ‚ú®

The starting point for this project was a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/student-dashboard). This was my first time writing any kind of backend code - I am extremely grateful for the well-written tutorial and the starting point of the Canvas API node modules.
